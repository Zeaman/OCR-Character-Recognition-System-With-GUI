# OCR-Character-Recognition-System-With-GUI
This project implements a deep learning-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system for alphanumeric characters (A-Z, 0-9). The system uses a modified ResNet18 architecture trained on custom datasets to recognize individual characters with high accuracy.
